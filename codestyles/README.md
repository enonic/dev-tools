# Code styles

To install code styles in IntelliJ, do the following on Mac OSX:

	> cp idea/*.xml ~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea11/codestyles/.
	
When the code styles are copied to the right folder, open IntelliJ. Then under _Settings_ > _Code Style_ set _Enonic_ as scheme. Remember to apply the settings.
